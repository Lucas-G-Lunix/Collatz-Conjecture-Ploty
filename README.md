# Collatz Conjecture Graphing Algorithm in Python

This script helps you graph the Collatz Conjecture for the numbers you want. It uses the Ploty library for graphing all the numbers. 

The interface is CLI; one improvement for the future is making a GUI in Tkinter or a Web GUI that retrieves the graph on the same page.

**Any improvement in the code is welcome**
